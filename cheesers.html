    <div class = "steps">
        <h3>Step 1.</h3>
        <img class = "Cheesecake" src="images/cheeser/cheees.jpg">
        <p>Put the curd in a large bowl. Best for cheeses suitable curd with a fat content of 5-9%. Crumbled and <br/>dry cottage cheese is better to break through with a blender, so that in the cheeses there are no particles of undisturbed curd.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "steps">
        <h3>Step 2.</h3>
        <img class = "Cheesecake" src = "images/cheeser/step2.jpg">
        <p>If the curd is soft and plastic, you can not use a blender. This quality is usually matched with fat plastic curd.<br/> If desired, you can make cheesecake and skim cheese.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "steps" >
        <h3>Step 3.</h3>
        <p>Pour 100 g of flour into a bowl of cottage cheese and add a small pinch of salt. Stir the curd dough thoroughly <br/>until it is homogeneous with a silicone shovel or fork.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "steps">
        <h3>Step 4.</h3>
        <img class = "Cheesecake" src = "images/cheeser/step4.jpg">
        <p>In a separate dish, combine the egg with ordinary and vanilla sugar. 
            Beat the mixer into a thick light foam.<br/> Pour the whipped egg into a bowl of curd dough and gently stir it with a spatula.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "steps">
